        <p>TLDR</p>
<p>At Frontier Communications, I enabled powerful analyses of disparate datasets by developing and maintaining complex cloud-based ETL pipelines. Subsequently, I built robust, predictive models and dashboards to empower network operations teams&rsquo; responses to customer service issues.</p>

<h1 id="description" class="anchor-link"><a href="#description">Description</a></h1>
<p>Though exact details are proprietary, I will highlight the breadth of the work that I&rsquo;ve performed at Frontier Communcations. For context, Frontier Communications is a large-sized telecommunications company, aiming to provide fiber and copper service across the United States. In my current role, I work on the network analytics team, harnessing network data (i.e., bit rates, outages) to push data-driven decisions for the operations teams.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge at Frontier involved growing the company&rsquo;s data maturity. Frontier, as an organization, had gathered a veritable gold mine of data by capturing automated responses from millions of network devices across the country (the size of one of the largest datasets was over a petabyte). However, I joined the company at a time when the tools to wrangle said data were underdeveloped. As such, I contributed to developing the architecture and protocols for extracting, processing, and analyzing data. The resulting data pipeline accelerated my ability to work with and analyze many internal datasets.</p>
<p>Being on the network team, reducing outages and optimizing network performance were a main driver for my projects. In one of my largest projects, I deployed a full-scale anomaly detection model, identifying several thousand customers that have recently experienced poor network service. I remember struggling with the many different ways to optimize the model performance. For example, I rigorously tested and reflected on the benefits and drawbacks of various outlier detection models (i.e., one-class SVMs, CBLOF, isolation forests, autoencoders) and ultimately made the most informed decision based on my sample analyses.</p>
<p>Additionally, here is a short list of my main responsbilities and achievements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructed numerous ETL pipelines by leveraging cloud-based services and data engineering practices</li>
<li>Compiled, cleaned, and processed various data sets stored across multiple platforms to generate a large-scale, standardized data lake used widely among cross-functional network teams</li>
<li>Swiftly delivered ad-hoc key analyses and insights to network teams</li>
<li>Developed machine learning models to detect anomalies in service among copper DSL customers</li>
</ul>
